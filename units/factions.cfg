This, in turn, leads to one question: is there anything, or anyone, living near the source of Creation? And if so, what strange nature would bloom under the sun of the beginning?"

Less of a concern is the binding of constructs; after all, these are mere machinery, without a possibility of free will or even of wielding magic. Indeed, the mere conjecturing that such machines could, one day, threaten to take over the world is generally laughed at.

And yet there are those who claim we should be thankful that machines will never be a match for sentient genius and magic prowess. For if they ever were to become such a match, their inability to tire or feel pain, their rebuilding capabilities and their sheer strength could easily overcome the soft creations of flesh and blood, and the entire natural world would be replaced by a world of metal and engine, the creations of Life reduced to mere fuel for unfeeling machines."

But even the eyes of magic and science are still limited; they fail to see that the void between the stars is not at all void, that it crawls with the echoes of those who came before - the early children of creation, who first set out to explore the stars, and who perished in the deepest mists of time.

One day, the children of Irdya might be strong enough to rise beyond their skies... and when they do, those who have risen before shall be ready to greet them."
