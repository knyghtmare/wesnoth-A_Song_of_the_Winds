Alas, in the last years of Hiera'Shirsha very few remained who had been close to her since her youth, and as the High Ascendant Maat herself remained somewhat aloof from most of her Windsong sisters. But one person who had always stood close by her side was Deianira. Like Maat herself, she was a young prodigy of the Windsong, a Seeker particularly skilled in the use of weather ciphers – a talent that earned her the name 'Scarlet Lightning.' Together they went on many a scouting mission – and even more escapades from under the watchful eyes of their elders."

A new tower was built to host the crypts of the dead Windsong; at its top, a grand mausoleum was built for the fallen Five Stars. However, unbeknownst to all except for Maat and Deianira themselves, Raika's remains were not interred there. Deianira had managed to find Angra Mazda's mangled remains and keep them secretly preserved; then, one night, while everyone rested, Maat helped her take both mother and son to the faraway Riverlands. The sun was rising when the Windsong finished the modest grave where Raika and Raihien were laid to rest, next to a small crystalline stream, together at last in the land where they had once been so happy."

It was an irony that, for all her desire to live forever, the only shards of her existence who remained were the ones who fought against her. Deianira was concerned that those few survivors of Kaliduniya might one day grow strong again and prey on other worlds, Irdya included; but Maat decided that their descendants and themselves deserved a chance to find in themselves the same strength Enlil had found, and live a better existence. After all, like the Tyrant had once told her, no being was born evil."
