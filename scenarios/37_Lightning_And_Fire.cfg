This last one was the first I found, and there Krathon found me. You had told me of Hiera'Saret too, of course, so when he told me of a Foundation lost in an inaccessible sea, I knew it had to be the one. Massive as he is, he was able to walk Hiera'Saret's halls, but only I could read its texts – also thanks to you, who used to sing to me in the Windsong Ceremonial Speech.
