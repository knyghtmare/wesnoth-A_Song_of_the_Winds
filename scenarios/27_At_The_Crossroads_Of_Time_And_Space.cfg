Now, look at the ciphers: the red ones are Sakti, the Cipher of Memory, which also has the power of draining; the blue ones are slowing ciphers... And all are activated already. This is my guess: someone with a affinity with the Raw must stand within that energy column at the centre, but channelling so much Raw energy at once could rip even an Ascendant apart. That's where the ciphers come into play: they drain the excess energy of the Raw stream, but since this energy must go somewhere, someone must stand on each cipher to take it into themselves."
