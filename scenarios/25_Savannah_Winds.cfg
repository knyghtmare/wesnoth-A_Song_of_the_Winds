But as an elf, I always knew I wanted to help those who could not help themselves to the best of my ability, and that crown allowed me to do that in a scale I might never have been able to as a mere civilian. If losing my personal freedom was the price to pay for that, then I'm glad I paid it. Now, maybe you have no wish to help those who cannot help themselves, and wishes to live your own life to the fullest; there is no shame in that.
