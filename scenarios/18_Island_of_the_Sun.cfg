That was when Solara, granddaughter of El-Teleryon and of the First Herself, developed arts that allowed her to channel the sun's energy even as the sun itself is blocked by clouds. As they shone with an aura like that of the sun itself, Solara and her shydes brought new life to the Lins-Elens, ensuring it remained a haven for our people."
